Optimo is a company that wants to create the next line of state-of-the-art robots.  However, the "brains" of the robot have had some slight difficulties.  That's where you, the debugger, get to repair the "brains" of the robot.
In this physical-based controller, the player ("debugger") have to push buttons and pull switches to eventually reach the goal of the "fixed brains" of the robot.
